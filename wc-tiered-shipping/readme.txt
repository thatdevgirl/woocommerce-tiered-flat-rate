Add a tiered flat rate shipping option for the WooCommerce plugin.

== Description ==

Admin users can create a tiered flat rate shipping fee based on the total number of items in a user's cart.  There are two tiers in this 
shipping method:

Base shipping fee: This is the base (default) flat shipping fee that is applied automatically to the cart total for any number of items.

Additional shipping fee for tiers: This is the additional shipping fee that is added to the base fee if the number of items in the user's 
cart exceeds a specified number.  This tiered fee can either be a flat fee, meaning that it is applied to carts of any size above the 
specified tier quantity, or a progressive fee, meaning that the tier quantity is used as a multipler to the tiered fee.

== Installation ==

Step 1: Upload the plugin to your WordPress installation and activate it.

Step 3: Profit!
